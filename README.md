# JSOxford meetups and events

We :green_heart: talks and events. It would be awesome to hear **your** talk, or to find out what you'd like to hear.

## Meetup format

Our evening meetups are pretty flexible, so whether you've got a 10-minute rant or a full blown 45-minute deep-dive there's a space for you. We generally aim for around 2 speakers.

## Submitting a talk
All you need to do is [open an issue](https://github.com/jsoxford/events/issues/new?labels=talk+proposal) with your talk title and description. The rules are simple:

- Agree to our [Code of Conduct](http://jsoxford.com/codeofconduct)
- Put the talk title in the issue title field.
- Set the issue description to be a brief overview of the talk. Be as verbose or succinct as you like.
- Add everything else as comments.
- Don't worry, it can all change later!

We will get in touch with you to discuss your talk and arrange a suitable date. We will also be available to help you with your talk preperation and speaking skills so don't worry if you're brand new to public speaking, we're here to help. :smile:

## After the event
If your slides are online, add the url as a comment (also tweet it to [@jsoxford](https://twitter.com/jsoxford) and we'll retweet!)

Thanks,
:heart: The JSOxford team

We've flagrantly stolen this approach from the great guys and girls at [NottsJS](https://github.com/nottsjs/speakers) and [LNUG](https://github.com/lnug).
