# JSOxford meetups and events

We :green_heart: talks and events. It would be awesome to hear **your** talk, or to find out what you'd like to hear.

## Meetup format

Our evening meetups are pretty flexible, so whether you've got a 10-minute rant or a full blown 45-minute deep-dive there's a space for you. We generally aim for around 3 speakers.

## Submitting a talk
All you need to do is [open an issue](https://github.com/jsoxford/events/issues/new) with your talk title and description. The rules are simple:

- Put the talk title in the issue title field.
- Set the issue description to be a brief overview of the talk. Be as verbose or succinct as you like.
- Add everything else as comments.
- Don't worry, it can all change later!

Talks will be assigned to milestones to schedule them for an event. Check the milestone for additional information, or get in touch with us.

## After the event
If your slides are online, add the url as a comment (also tweet it to [@jsoxford](https://twitter.com/jsoxford) and we'll retweet!)

Thanks,
:heart: The JSOxford team

We've flagrantly stolen this approach from the great guys and girls at [NottsJS](https://github.com/nottsjs/speakers) and [LNUG](https://github.com/lnug).
